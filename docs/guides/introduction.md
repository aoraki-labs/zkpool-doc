# Introduction
ZKPool A0-0 is dedicated to the Taiko A4 Testnet. As per the plan, ZKPool is set to expand into more ZKP projects soon.

ZKPool at the moment supports users to join as an individual prover worker or a group of prover workers of [Taiko Eldfell L3 (alpha-4) Testnet](https://taiko.mirror.xyz/HJCWBluTwmNyWRkhzIXXr0k5xAaalRNtmlyDMJTu_ws). 

Taiko Alpha-4 testnets comes with a new staking based prover economics. Blocks will be distributed to top 32 staked provers. To be one of the top 32 provers, a substantial amount of Taiko token and capacity of prover workers (mininum 32) are required. It's very hard for smaller and solo provers to successfully compete in this staking contest. 

ZKPool aims to provide the following capabilities:

* ZKPool gathers smaller provers' capacity together and stake as a pool
* ZKPool operates to minimize the risks of being slashed 
* ZKPool calculates the rewards of provers
* ZKPool makes it really easy for provers to join

At the first stage, ZKPool will stake by itself on behalf of all provers connected to the pool. Pool is open to registered provers to connect to.
