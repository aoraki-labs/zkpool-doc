# ZKPool A1

## Taiko Project Support

Taiko is a decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent zk-rollup project with Type 1 zkEVM technology.

ZKPool A1 is dedicated to the [Taiko Alpha-5 (A5) Testnet](https://taiko.mirror.xyz/0jc5XA5RVjOUNVdRdGmw9prlsC4deA1XgZJppmXh8rs), and supports users who wish to join as individual provers.

## Hardware Requirements

ZKPool supports various provers joining, including those using CPUs, GPUs, and more.

ZKPool will provide both CPU and GPU binaries (coming soon) and will also open-source [the prover client codes](https://github.com/aoraki-labs/zkpool-prover) to support third parties to build their hardware binaries.

Hardware that meets the minimum requirements can run the CPU prover binary:

- 8 or 16 core CPU
- 32 GB memory

## Reward Distribution

As ZKPool assumes the risk of slashing, covers the Gas fee for submitting proofs, and handles operation costs, it will share the reward of tokens with provers. The current distribution rule is:

- ZKPool: 20%
- Prover: 80%

Note: 

1. The distribution rule is solely for testing purposes on the Testnet. ZKPool reserves the right and plans to adjust it in the future.
2. The default reward token is ETH, and ZKPool may introduce additional ERC20 tokens as rewards, such as TTKOj.
3. Rewards are calculated over specific intervals, for example, on a daily basis.
4. Currently, rewards cannot be withdrawn and will be recorded under the prover's account. ZKPool plans to upgrade soon to enable users to withdraw the tokens.
5. The actual value of the reward is not guaranteed. Participation is primarily to assist Taiko in testing and becoming a successful zk-rollup.
6. ZKPool may offer additional incentives from the platform side, especially for early participants, although this has not yet been finalized.
