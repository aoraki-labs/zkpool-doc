# ZKPool A1

## Taiko Project Support

Taiko is a decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent zk-rollup project with Type 1 zkEVM technology.

ZKPool A1 is dedicated to the [Taiko Alpha-5 (A5) Testnet](https://taiko.mirror.xyz/0jc5XA5RVjOUNVdRdGmw9prlsC4deA1XgZJppmXh8rs), and supports users who want to join as individual provers.

## Hardware Requirements

ZKPool supports various provers to join, CPU, GPU, and so on. 

ZKPool will provide both CPU and GPU binaries (coming soon), and it also open-source [the prover client codes](https://github.com/aoraki-labs/zkpool-prover) to support 3rd party to build its hardware binary.

The hardware that meets the minimum requirements can run CPU prover binary:

- 8 or 16 core CPU
- 32 GB memory

## Reward Distribution

As ZKPool takes the risk of slashing, pays the Gas fee for submitting the proof and operation cost, ZKPool will share the reward of tokens with provers. Currently the distribution rule is:

- ZKPool: 20%
- Prover: 80%

Note: 

1. The distribution rule is only for testing purposes in the Testnet. ZKPool has the right and plans to adjust it in the future.
2. The default reward token is ETH, and ZKPool may add more ERC20 tokens as reward, such as TTKOj.
3. Rewards are calculated based on a specific interval, such as on a daily basis.
4. Currently, rewards cannot be withdrawn and will be recorded under the prover's account. ZKPool will soon upgrade to support users in withdrawing the tokens.
5. The actual value of the reward is not guaranteed. We participate to help Taiko test and become a successful zk-rollup.
6. ZKPool may consider offering additional incentives from the platform side, especially for early participants. However, this has not yet been determined.
